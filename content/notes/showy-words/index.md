Do you ever roll your eyes at manuals?

I do, at least when the writing is full of showy words that make the meaning unclear. I love technical documents, and I know technical writers often have to deal with weird requirements. So I roll my eyes with affection, but still, they roll.

A few years ago, I started keeping this list of showy words. When I notice a new one, I add it, along with a couple plain-language alternatives. It’s a good reminder to use the most natural word that expresses my meaning. Hey, I don’t want to qualify for my own list [*she said nervously*].

Yes, this is my idea of fun…why do you ask?!
