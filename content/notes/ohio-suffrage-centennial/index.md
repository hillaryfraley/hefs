description: "A Jekyll website to share information about Ohio's role in woman suffrage"

<br>

In early 2018, I took a tour of the [Harriet Beecher Stowe house](https://www.stowehousecincy.org/index.html) here in Cincinnati. A woman on the same tour really stood out because she was wearing a bright sash with yellow, white, and purple stripes that said "VOTES FOR WOMEN" in big letters.

When the tour ended, I started chatting with the woman in the sash. She was researching Cincinnati's contributions to the woman suffrage movement and had designed the sash pattern herself based on those worn by suffragists. The 100th anniversary of U.S. woman suffrage was approaching, and she hoped to motivate the city to celebrate its connections. But she needed a website.

Well, I am always looking for a reason to fiddle around with a static site generator! I offered to help with the website.

And that is how I met [Katherine Durack](https://www.linkedin.com/in/katherinedurack/), a powerhouse when it comes to getting things done. In addition to the website, she wrote, voiced, and helped produce the [Genius of Liberty podcast](https://soundcloud.com/thegeniusofliberty) and helped get [three historical markers placed in Cincinnati](https://www.cincinnati.com/story/news/2022/04/02/national-votes-women-trail-markers-cincinnati-suffragists-us-history/7223148001/) to bring attention to the city's role in winning women's right to vote. She must have given a hundred talks about local connections to woman suffrage, and she also designed [suffrage-inspired crochet patterns](https://www.ravelry.com/designers/katherine-durack)!

Katherine explained her ideas for the website, and we decided on a Jekyll theme. She wrote the content and chose images based on her research, and I adjusted the template and added her content to the site. We published the site with Netlify, and it lived at `www.ohiosuffragecentennial.com` for several years. I continued to add updates and events to the site until early 2020. It was a lot of fun!

The site is no longer live, but I posted it on GitHub Pages at https://hillaryfraley.github.io/ohsuffragecentennialsite/ so you can see what it looked like. The repo with the original README is at https://github.com/hillaryfraley/ohsuffragecentennialsite. All of the content belongs to Katherine&mdash;I only worked on the site itself.
